# PREMIER LEAGUE LEGENDS FANTASY TEAM

# BRIEF

The overall objective of this project was to create a CRUD application with the utilistation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulates all the core modules that has been covered during my training. 

For this project I decided to create a fantasy football app that would have a database of premier league legends. This app would allow the user to create multiple teams and save them, as well as editing their current teams or deleting them.
